# npm-overlapping-marker-spiderfier
Npm pack https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier

This module uses the already compiled and minimized js library.
After importing this package, it populates the Spiderifier class to
`window.OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier`.

That's not so nice, however the solution should provided in the upsream package.
This is only a very thin wrapper.
